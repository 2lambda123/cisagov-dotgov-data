# .gov data

This repository contains the official, full list of registered domains from the [.gov top-level domain](https://home.dotgov.gov). This includes .gov domains from the US Government's executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as states, territories, tribes, cities, and counties. Domain information is updated regularly.

These files list the domains that have been _registered_ in the [.gov registrar](https://domains.dotgov.gov). Presence here *doesn't* necessarily mean there's an internet-accessible website, email server, or other online service operated publicly on the domain.

**This list doesn't accept pull requests** from government organizations or the public. If you manage one of these domains and
* metadata about it is incorrect, log in to the [.gov registrar](https://domains.dotgov.gov) to correct it.
* you want to transfer it to a different agency, step through the [domain ownership transfer process](https://home.dotgov.gov/management/#how-do-i-transfer-my-domain-to-a-different-agency).

If you use any of this data or notice anything that seems off, let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/issues) and telling us about it. You may also be interested in the [repo](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-home) for .gov's home page.
