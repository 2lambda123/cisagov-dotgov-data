# .gov domains

These files contain .gov domain information from the federal government's executive, legislative, and judicial branches -- as well as states, territories, cities, counties, and native tribes.

Domain information is updated every ~month. As such, **this list doesn't accept pull requests** from federal agencies or the public. 
* To change .gov metadata, log in to the [.gov registrar](https://domains.dotgov.gov). 
* To transfer your domain to a different agency, complete the [domain ownership transfer process](https://home.dotgov.gov/management/#how-do-i-transfer-my-domain-to-a-different-agency).

Note that these files list the domains that have been _registered_; just because a domain is registered doesn't mean there's a website, email address, or other service operating on the domain.

## Public (unofficial) uses
