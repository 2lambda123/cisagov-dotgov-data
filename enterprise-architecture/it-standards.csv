It is designed to run on multiple operating systems while providing robust integration with each underlying OS. Plug-ins can program to the Eclipse portable APIs and run unchanged on any of the supported operating systems. At the core of Eclipse is an architecture for dynamic discovery, loading, and running of plug-ins. The platform handles the logistics of finding and running the right code. The platform UI provides a standard user navigation model. Each plug-in can then focus on doing a small number of tasks well. What kinds of tasks: Defining, testing, animating, publishing, compiling, debugging, diagramming...the only limit is your imagination.","Type":"Software","Category":"IDE-Integrated Development Environment","Status":"Exception","DeploymentType":"Desktop","Comments":"","POC":"Robert Donovan","POCorg":"Cloud Integration (IQSI)","ReferenceDocuments":["<a class=\"no-propagation\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1Zt0000000Cmem\"> https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1Zt0000000Cmem</a>"],"Refdocdetail":["https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1Zt0000000Cmem"],"ApprovalExpirationDate":"2019-09-01"},{"ID":592,"Name":"Eclipse Oxygen 4.x","Description":"Eclipse is an open source community of Tools, Projects and \n Collaborative Working Groups.","Type":"Software","Category":"IDE-Integrated Development Environment","Status":"Exception","DeploymentType":"Server","Comments":"Approved as an Exception due to 508 compliance.","POC":"Pamela Miller","POCorg":"Cloud Integration (IQSI)","ReferenceDocuments":["<a class=\"no-propagation\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1Zt0000000ATxP\"> https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1Zt0000000ATxP</a>"],"Refdocdetail":["https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1Zt0000000ATxP"],"ApprovalExpirationDate":"2019-09-01"},{"ID":593,"Name":"EC-Net AX Supervisor Distech","Description":"EC-NetAX Supervisor flexible graphical user interface provides traditional building management functions such as scheduling, trending, alarming, historical data collection and advanced energy management applications.

Xcode pulls all the tools together needed to develop an application helping developers to have everything in one place including user design, coding, testing, debugging and compiling. Conexus mac developers need this because it also allows them to compile and run code from other unix-like systems, including Linux, which is what Conexus is built on. Our developers using macs are much more efficient and productive in the xcode IDE. 7.x isn't supported in the current macOS System.","Type":"Software","Category":"IDE-Integrated Development Environment","Status":"Approved","DeploymentType":"Desktop","Comments":"508 Exception.","POC":"Luis Palacios","POCorg":"Infra Capabilities (IDTB)","ReferenceDocuments":["<a class=\"no-propagation\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gsa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Request_Tracker__c/a1Zt0000000MAA9EAO/view\"> https://gsa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Request_Tracker__c/a1Zt0000000MAA9EAO/view</a>"],"Refdocdetail":["https://gsa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Request_Tracker__c/a1Zt0000000MAA9EAO/view"],"ApprovalExpirationDate":"2022-11-04"},{"ID":2627,"Name":"Forticlient VPN 6.x","Description":"The eRulemaking system is currently hosted within the EPA data center- NCC and EPA Potomac Yard (DR).  All privileged remote system administrators access the environments through VPN. The client used is Forticlient 6.4, which is technology that was brought over when GSA inherited eRulemaking as a system of record from EPA. In order to maintain continuity of service we must continue to use this client as there is one VPN tunnel configured with multiple Fortinet and Fortigate web and network firewalls. Re-deploying a new VPN solution is not feasible as this is a high availability system. The contract that supports the Fortinet services was recently renewed as part of O&M requirements. As a result , the VPN client service is funded by GSA. As eRulemaking continues infrastructure modernization and migration activities in accordance with GSA security policies ,support personnel require the ability to install Forticlent VPN on GSA GFE.","Type":"Software","Category":"Infrastructure","Status":"Approved","DeploymentType":"Server","Comments":"508 compliance unknown.","POC":"Nick Pierrelouis","POCorg":null,"ReferenceDocuments":["<a class=\"no-propagation\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gsa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Request_Tracker__c/a1Zt0000000fyXXEAY/view\"> https://gsa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Request_Tracker__c/a1Zt0000000fyXXEAY/view</a>"],"Refdocdetail":["https://gsa.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Request_Tracker__c/a1Zt0000000fyXXEAY/view"],"ApprovalExpirationDate":"2022-11-04"},{"ID":2628,"Name":"MS Office ProPlus (MOPP) for Macintosh","Description":"The request is to move the MS Office ProPlus Desktop software for Macintosh with no cloud components from Pilot to Proof of Concept (POC).
